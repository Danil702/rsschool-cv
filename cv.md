# ABOUT ME:
I have recently started studying programming, I have always been interested in how websites, programs, antiviruses, etc. work. I started my journey with HTML, CSS and JS. I studied from https://learn.javascript.ru/ and videos on GetCourse. So far, I'm not doing very well, but I want to say so far, because I have a great desire and incentive to work. I really want to become a website developer for some Korean company. I am learning their language and in the future I want to study there and maybe even stay to live. I believe in myself and in my abilities and that I will be able to master all the work at this school
# CODE EXAMPLE
8 kyu Returning Strings
Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".
[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]
```
function greet(name){
  if(typeof name == 'string'){
    return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
  }else{
    return 0;
  }
}
```
